        <h2>What is Vantablack???</h2><br><br>

        <p>You may wonder what is Vantablack, isn't it just a name of a kind of black?
        You are wrong if you think about that. Vantablack is the brand name for a new class 
        of super-black coatings. The coatings are unique in that they all have hemispherical 
        reflectances below 1% and also retain that level of performance from all viewing angles.   
        </p><br>

        <p>
            The original coating known just as Vantablack® was a super-black coating that holds
            the independently verified world record as the darkest man-made substance.
            It was originally developed for satellite-borne blackbody calibration systems, 
            but due to limitations in how it was manufactured its been surpassed by our spray applied Vantablack coatings.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Vantablack Coating Range</h2><br>
            <ul>
                <li> Vantablack S-VIS (UV-THz performance - space qualified)</li>
                <li> Vantablack S-IR   (Optimised from 5-14um - space qualified for blackbody applications)</li>
                <li>Vantablack VBx2 (Terrestrial applications from UV-THz)</li>
            </ul><br>

        <h2>Typical Coating Properties</h2><br>
            <ul>
                <li> Ultra-low reflectance - exceptional performance from all angles</li>
                <li> UV, Visible and IR absorption - Absorption works from UV (200-350 nm wavelength), 
                through the visible (350-700nm) and into the far infrared (>600 microns) spectrum, with no spectral features.
                </li>
                <li>Super hydrophobic - Unlike other black coatings, humidity will not degrade the optical properties</li>
                <li>Very high thermal shock resistance - Repeatedly plunging a Vantablack S-VIS coated substrate into liquid Nitrogen at -196°C and then transferring to a 200°C hot plate in air does not affect its properties.</li>
                <li>Resistant to shock and vibration - Independently tested, coatings have been subjected to shock and vibration simulating launch and staging.</li>
                <li>Low outgassing and mass loss - Independent testing to ECSS shows TML < 0.5 </li>
                <li>Excellent BDRF and TIS performance - Even at shallow angles the levels of blackness outperforms all other commercial super-black coatings</li>

            </ul>
